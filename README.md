# [Party-ify](https://nathanielw.github.io/party-ify/)

Website that turns any image into a GIF in the style of the party-parrot emoji.

Built as a weekend hack _(quickly becoming multi-weekend when I forgot how to geometry)_ so bugs and weird things are likely.

## Running

This site is built using create-react-app, which provides a few scripts:

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
